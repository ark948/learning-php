PHP PDO is a database access layer that provides a uniform interface for working with databases

PDO allows for working with any database that has a PDO driver available
it relies on database-specific drivers
such as PDO_MYSQL, PDO_PGSQL, PDO_OCI for oracle database

Therefore, to use PDO for a specific database, you need to have a corresponding database driver available.
