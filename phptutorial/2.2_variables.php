<?php

// a variable stores a value of any kind

$title = "PHP is awesome!";

// to display the value of a variable, we can use echo construct

echo $title;

// another shorter way of displaying the value is this:
/*
<?= $variable_name ?>
*/
// this works on embedded php code only

// it is recommended to NOT mix html with PHP

// require statement can be used to copy php code from a file to another
