    // Created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994
    // maintained by the PHP development team

    // PHP runs on the web server, processes the web request and generates a response
    
    // there are two types of languages (regarding the purpose of languages)
    // domain specific such as SQL (which is used for querying data from relational databases)
    // PHP is a general purpose language and a cross-platform language
    // it can run on Linux, Windows and MacOS
    // and in many leading web servers such as: Nginx, OpenBSD, Apache
    // and many cloud environments such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS

    // aside from HTML, php can also generate PDF, GIF, JPEG, PNG

    // it supports many databases such as mysql, postgresql, MS SQL, db2, Oracle database and MongoDB

    // PHP is suited for developing dynamic web applications and websites
    // and Command-line scripting, just like python and perl, php can be used to perform administrative tasks such as
    // sending emails and generating PDFs
