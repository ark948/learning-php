<?php

    // to run php code we'll typically need:
    // PHP itself
    // a web server that supports PHP such as Apache webserver
    // a database server such as MySQL

    // these can be installed separately, but using a all-in-one package such as XAMPP is better

    // by default, Apache uses ports 80 and 443
    // if port 80 is already being used by another service or software
    // you need to configure Apache to use another port like 8080
    // to do that, on XAMPP, next to Apache service, click on config -> Apache (httpd.conf)
    // change the line Listen 80 to Listen 8080
