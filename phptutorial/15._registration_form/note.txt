this lesson comes after 14.20_password_verify.php

this project will contain a form that user will fill
we sanitize and validate the user inputs
if form data is not valid, show the form again with user inputs and errors
if form is valid, insert the user data into the users database table, show a flash message, redirect the user to login.php
the login form will be the next project



config:	Store the configuration file such as database configuration
public:	Store the public files accessed directly by the users
src:	Store the source files that should not be exposed to the public
src/inc:	Store the commonly included files such as the header and footer of a page
src/libs:	Store the library files, e.g., validation, sanitization, etc.

there are two register.php files, one in public, one in src
this is to separate logic and view parts
