<?php

    // this file must go in C://xampp/htdocs/

    // we can also use command line: cmd> php helloworld.php
    // this will generate the pure HTML code

    
    // if you are embedding php inside an html file, the opening and closing php tags are required.

    // however if you are just using php code in a php file, the closing tag is not required. just like this file
